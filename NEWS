* Version 1 of a visual matching game. The object is to find sets of
  three cards where each attribute—color, shape, number of elements,
  and shading—either match on all three cards or are different on all
  three cards. Version 1 doesn't yet support sharing with multiple
  players or saving to the Journal, but it can be played by a single
  player.
